Bill Wagner  Helped revitalize N.Y. wine industry Bill Wagner, 83, a winery owner who played a major role in revitalizing the Finger Lakes wine industry in west-central New York beginning in the 1970s, died Saturday at his home in Lodi, N.Y., said his son John. The cause was not disclosed. Wagner grew grapes on his family’s farm for more than three decades before producing his first wines for sale in 1979 as founder of Wagner Vineyards on the eastern shore of Seneca Lake. He quickly earned renown for growing European-American hybrid grapes. Best known for its Rieslings, the winery produces 35 wines from 20 grape varieties grown on 250 acres of vineyards. A third-generation farmer, Stanley A. “Bill” Wagner was born in Elmira, N.Y., in 1927. He dropped out of high school to join the Navy in World War II, then returned to the farm where his parents’ crops included grapes, cherries and peaches. Wagner bought a few acres of land and grew grapes for local New York winemakers before focusing on growing grapes for his own winery. He added a microbrewery in 1997. Algirdas Brazauskas Lithuania’s first freely elected president Algirdas Brazauskas, 77, Lithuania’s first post-independence president, died Saturday at his home in the capital of Vilnius, his wife said. He had cancer. Brazauskas became Lithuania’s first freely elected president in 1993, two years after the Baltic state regained independence from Moscow following five decades of Soviet occupation. Born Sept. 22, 1932, in Rokiskis, Lithuania, Brazauskas was a former chairman of the Lithuanian Communist Party who gained popularity in the late 1980s by challenging the Kremlin with demands for more political and economic freedom. He ignored threats from the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, and decided to break away from the Soviet Union’s Communist Party and formed the Democratic Labour Party that became one of Lithuania’s key political forces and later merged with Social Democrats. Brazauskas did not run for a second term in 1998 but was elected prime minister in 2000. -- Times staff and wire reports news.obits@latimes.com
